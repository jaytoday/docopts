# docopts examples

Thoses scripts are bash source code examples, they expect to find `docopts` binary in `$PATH`.
All examples change their `$PATH` to first use the `docopts` built by go in the main project folder.

Then:

```
cd to/the/examples/directory
# and try any code localy:
./quick_example.sh --help
```

Change dir to subfolder, the same way, if you want to try other examples.
